# Next Steps
- [ ] local runtime for binance

- [ ] init exchange info from within it. Test we can access min size for symbol of the order.

- [ ] transition all interactions with binance to be passed to this runtime; make all calls to exchange info static.

- [ ] make account info static

- [ ] debug STOP_MARKET orders placement

# General
- [ ] transition acquisition to follow the protocols standard

- [ ] dynamically pull max_order_size and max_leverage for all futures pairs

- [ ] automatically adjust leverage to absolute minimum; to diminish carry costs
